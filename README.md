Hi, my name is **Lucas Costa**, it's a pleasure to have you here.

A little about myself: 🤭

 - 💻 Student in Systems Analysis and Development - Unifacs; _(and future junior developer)_
 - 🏗️ Student in Civil Engineer - UFBA; _(but, in the process of career migration)_
 - 🗃️ An organized and methodical guy; _(discipline is essential)_
 - 📤 Always trying to think outside the box; _(creativity moves the world)_
 - 🌄 Always open to new opportunities; _(driven by new challenges)_


Anyway, I believe we **don't** always need to **invent the wheel**, but we should always look for a way to **make it spin faster**!
  
Thank you for getting here and let's walk together, count on me to contribute to your journey, Bye! 🙋‍♂️
